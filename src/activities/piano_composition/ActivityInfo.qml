This activity covers many fundamental aspects of music, but there is much more to explore about music composition.

  Level 1: Basic piano keyboard (white keys only) and students can experiment with clicking the colored rectangle keys to write music.
  Level 2: The musical staff switches to bass clef, so pitches are lower than in previous level.
  Level 3: Option to choose between treble and bass clef, addition of black keys (sharp keys).
  Level 4: Flat notation used for black keys.
  Level 5: Option to select note duration (whole, half, quarter, eighth notes).
  Level 6: Addition of rests (whole, half, quarter, eighth rests)
  Level 7: Load children's melodies from around the world and also save your composition.
