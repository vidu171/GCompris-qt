If you clicked tempo at correct times, another rhythm is displayed. If not, you must try again.<br>Odd levels display a vertical playing line when you click the drum, which helps you see when to click, to follow the rhythm. Click on the drum when the line is in the middle of the notes.<br>Even levels are harder, because there is no vertical playing line. You must read the rhythm, and click it back in tempo. Click the metronome to hear the quarter note tempos.<br>Click on the reload button to replay the rhythm.")
